                <h6>You would have heard about Digital Marketing come up as an exciting career option. The Pew Research
                    concludes that the constant internet usage among adults has increased by 5% in the last three years.
                    This means that the way people interact, buy, sell and transact businesses have really changed and
                    online marketing is proving to be an effective way forward.

                    Marketing is about making a connection with the audience at the right time and place. And today, if
                    we need to meet people, then we must meet them where they are already spending too much time, which
                    is the internet or the mobile. If you are asked â€“ Do not look at your mobile for the next 30 hours,
                    then can you do it?

                    ðŸ™‚ So now you know whyâ€¦ Thus, this is where Digital Marketing i.e. any form of marketing that exists
                    online comes into the picture.</h6>
